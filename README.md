
# Blood Donation Prediction using Machine Learning 💉🤖



This repository contains code for predicting blood donation likelihood using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project (`transfusion.data`) contains information about individuals' blood donation history.

## Steps Taken 📝

### Data Loading and Preprocessing 📊

- Loaded the dataset from a CSV file (`transfusion.data`).
- Renamed the target column to "target".
- Checked the data types and basic information about the dataset.

### Data Splitting 📂

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection`.

### Model Training with TPOT 🚀

- Trained the `TPOTClassifier` model to find the best pipeline for predicting blood donation likelihood.
- Evaluated the model's performance on the testing data using ROC AUC score.

### Log Transformation 📉

- Normalized the specified column ("Monetary (c.c. blood)") using log transformation.
- Checked the variance of the normalized data.

### Model Training with Logistic Regression 📈

- Trained a logistic regression model using the normalized training data.
- Evaluated the logistic regression model's performance on the testing data using ROC AUC score.

### Model Comparison 📊

- Compared the performance of the TPOT model and logistic regression model based on their AUC scores.

### Model Serialization 📦

- Serialized the trained logistic regression model using pickle and saved it to a file (`logistic_regression_model.pkl`).
- Demonstrated loading the saved model from the file for future use.

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3

### Libraries 📚

- numpy
